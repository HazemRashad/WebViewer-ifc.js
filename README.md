A lightweight, ultra-fast IFC viewer built with [Fragments 2.0](https://github.com/thatopencompany/fragments). View, explore, and analyze BIM models directly in the browser without Revit or desktop software.

## 🔧 Features
- Load `.ifc` and `.frag` models instantly
- Real-time 3D navigation (Orbit, Pan, Zoom)
- Element selection and property display
- Isolate, hide, and reset model views
- Fully browser-based – no plugins required

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Fragments 2.0 (WebGL engine)
- Three.js (under the hood)
- HTML, CSS

## 🚀 Performance
- Handles large IFC files with minimal memory overhead  
- GPU-accelerated rendering using Fragments compression  
- Optimized selection, filtering, and rendering pipelines  

## ✅ Requirements
- Any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
- Pre-converted `.frag` files (use `convert` from Fragments CLI)

## 🗺️ Roadmap
- Section planes and measurements
- Multi-model federation
- Export selection to JSON/CSV
